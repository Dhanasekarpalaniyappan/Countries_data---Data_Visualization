Here I have shared my hands-on file. In this I explored describtive analysis using famous and significant python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.

At the end I gather some inference from the data.

At first I download the "Countries" dataset from Kaggle which is in CSV format.
Then I remove all the outliers in the dataset using boxplot and Scatterplot.
Then dataset explored to all the plotings in Seaborn and Matplotlib
